## Hello PR!
How to merge the remote to local!?
```
$ git push origin <branch>
```
The <branch> means remote branch or local branch?

```
$ git push/push origin <source>:<destination>
```
when push, ommied source, and when pull, ommied destination?
I mean local branch is defaulted to current branch.

`git push origin master` means I push current branch to remote's master???
and
`git pull origin master` means I pull remote's master to current branch???

## Hello issue???
